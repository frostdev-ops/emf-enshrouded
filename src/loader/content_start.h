// The content loader's start sequence (docs/engine_parts/content_loader.md), with every side effect injected so the
// tests can check the order. The licence rules it keeps:
//   1. emf_content.dll is loaded only on the held entry (the main thread, the loader lock free, before any game code),
//      before any chained DLL, EMF's core or a mod;
//   2. it is unloaded before they start; when it cannot be (a thread of its own still runs, the module is still there,
//      or the build does not come back), this start runs without the chained DLLs and without EMF's core, and says why
//      (a message box: the player gets no mods this time);
//   3. it is never loaded for a build when the fingerprint and the state say the shadow copy is current, nor after a
//      build with the same files failed (until a mod, the game or the DLL changes). It can still be loaded at such a
//      start, on the held entry and under rules 1 and 2, to draw the creature pictures mods ask for (portraits_plan.h);
//      never with [content] mode=off, on the dedicated server, or in Play without EMF mods.
//
// In DllMain: plan_content (the facts, the decision, the fingerprint and the state), then start_in_dllmain:
//   Off          today's order: the chained DLLs, the file hooks of the redirect spike's switches, the core
//   UseCurrent   the same, with the hooks sending the game's data opens to the shadow copy
//   KnownFailed  the same with the redirect forced off, and the core told (a build with these files failed before)
//   BuildHeld    only the hold of the exe's entry; everything else runs there (run_held_content). If the entry
//                cannot be held, content is off for this start and the order is today's.
// On the held entry, run_held_content: the splash, a state that is never current, the shadow and the build (on a
// worker thread while the splash is kept alive), the state, shadow.txt after a good build, then the chained DLLs, the
// hooks (redirect on only after a good build) and the core. The pictures come after the build's state is written (a
// pictures call never changes it), each call in a work of its own with its own time (draw_pictures), and with the
// attempt recorded as failed before the call, so that a crash or a hang there is remembered. Without a build the entry
// is held for them alone (run_held_portraits).
