// Move orders (API v40): a creature with the enemy AI walked to points through the game's own guard order
// (StartGuardingEvent) on a hidden waypoint EMF spawns at the point (private spec move-order 2026-11-12; live spike: a
// guard order on an entity 25 m away walked a Vukah straight there). At each point the waypoint goes and a new one is
// spawned at the next. The guard order is sent again every kMoveResendMs while the creature is not fighting and not
// guarding its waypoint (the game ends a guard on Stuck). It may fight on the way (the game's way); EMF_MOVE_PEACEFUL
// clears its fights against players each step. A waypoint that vanishes is placed again (at most kMoveReplaceMax times,
// once per kMoveResendMs). The order ends: arrived (the last point within `arrive` across, or within the creature's guard
// distance + 1 m once it guards the waypoint: it stops that far short; and that + 2 m up or down), stuck (no metre of
// progress for kMoveStuckMs while not fighting), timeout, gone (the creature
// died, went, became a player or a player's ally without EMF_MOVE_ALLIES), cancelled (cancel, a new move on it, the
// world closing). Then the waypoint goes and the guard orders still waiting for the creature are dropped (Deps::unguard);
// a creature that guarded someone (still there) before the move guards them again, any other
// stops guarding, and on arrival its home becomes the last point (it stays there). Game-free: the world is reached
// through Deps; step() on the server world's thread; the callback runs after the order is gone (it may start another).
