// Doors (API v38): open, close and lock doors and gates from the server, through the internal server program
// "emf_doors" and the game's own writeOther (private research doors_2026-11-12.md: the state is
// ServerToggleState.state, the swing DirectionalInteraction.state; a lock is InteractionOfferRuntime.isDisabled, held
// each step since the game does not save it). Locks are kept per world (Deps::save, load_saved) by the door's place:
// entity ids change between loads; after a load the door at each saved place is looked for and locked again.
