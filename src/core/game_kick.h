// Refusing a join: the game's own admin kick, server side (private research kick_player_2026-11-09.md). An admin's
// kick reaches handleAccountAction(GameServer*, const AccountActionEvent*) after the world tick; EMF calls that handler
// with its own Kick event, so the kick is exactly the admin's: the account is looked up when it runs, players with
// CanKickBan (admins, the host) are skipped, nothing is stored (the player can rejoin) and the target's game shows the
// game's "kicked" popup. Only Kick (0) is ever passed, never Ban (1) or UnBan (2): both write the ban lists.
