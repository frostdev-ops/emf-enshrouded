/* request_json (UTF-8):
     {"game_dir": "<folder holding enshrouded.kfc and mods\\>", "file_name": "enshrouded", "force": false,
      "server": null}
   file_name is optional (enshrouded or enshrouded_server when its .kfc or .exe is there, else the first .kfc or .exe);
   force rebuilds even when nothing changed; server is optional (null: EML decides from the file name). The run
   always patches, never exports and never registers runtime DLLs. For tests only, "test_panic": "<message>" makes
   the call panic with that message (it gives EMF_CONTENT_PANIC).

   log may be NULL. It is called only on the calling thread, during the call. It must return normally: no C++
   exception and no longjmp may leave it.

   One call at a time, over both calls: a call made while another runs (from another thread, or from inside the log
   callback) gives EMF_CONTENT_BAD_REQUEST at once. Call emf_content_build, emf_content_portraits and FreeLibrary on
   the same thread.

   reply: a NUL-terminated UTF-8 JSON
     {"code": n, "message": "...", "mods": [{"id": "...", "version": "..."}],
      "mod_errors": [{"id": "..." or null, "path": "...", "error": "..."}], "dlls": ["..."], "ms": n}
   *reply_len is always set to the full reply's byte length with the NUL (reply_len must not be NULL: BAD_REQUEST).
   When reply_cap < *reply_len, the reply is cut to fit: it keeps the real code and ms, adds "truncated": true, has
   empty lists and as much of the message as fits, and the call still returns the real code. Only when not even that
   fits (about 100 bytes), or reply is NULL, does the call return EMF_CONTENT_REPLY_TOO_SMALL and write nothing; the
   build has run then and its result is unknown. Pass a big buffer (1 MB). */

/* emf_content_portraits: frames of game models turning, drawn from the game's own files (read-only) into a cache
   folder. Same conventions as emf_content_build: log, one call at a time, reply_len, a cut reply, no panic out.

   request_json (UTF-8):
     {"game_dir": "<folder holding enshrouded.kfc and enshrouded.exe>", "file_name": "enshrouded",
      "cache_dir": "<game>\\emf\\cache\\portraits",
      "items": [{"key": "wolf", "template": "<template GUID>", "frames": 24, "size": 256},
                {"key": "boar", "model": "<render model GUID>"}]}
   game_dir and cache_dir are needed (cache_dir a full path); file_name as for emf_content_build. Per item: key (1 to
   64 of A-Z a-z 0-9 _ . -, not ending in a dot, not a Windows device name such as CON or COM1, unique ignoring case);
   model (a keen::RenderModel) or template (a keen::ecs::TemplateResource, drawn with its ModelResource's model), a
   GUID as text, exactly one of them; frames 1 to 64 (default 24); size 8 to 512 (default 256). A bad item fails
   alone. For tests only, "test_panic": "<message>" makes the call panic with that message.

   For each item: <cache_dir>\<key>\00.png, 01.png, ... (size x size RGBA8 PNG, sRGB, straight alpha, transparent
   background; frame i is the model turned by 360 * i / frames degrees, frame 0 a three-quarter view) and index.json
   (frames, size, the renderer's version, the template, and the inputs: the render model, its debugName, the content
   hashes of its render data and albedo textures, a hash of its records). An item whose index.json matches and whose
   frames are all there is left as it is ("current"); otherwise it is drawn again, index.json last, and frame files
   past the new count are removed. A failed item keeps the frames it had. The game's archive is opened once, and only
   when an item is good; nothing in the game folder is written.

   reply: a NUL-terminated UTF-8 JSON
     {"code": n, "message": "...", "items": [{"key": "...", "status": "drawn" | "current" | "failed",
      "model": "<render model GUID>", "name": "<its debugName>", "frames": n, "size": n, "error": "...",
      "notes": ["..."]}], "ms": n}
   items are in the request's order; key is null when the item had no key as text; model, name, frames and size are
   left out of a failed item, error out of a good one, notes (what was left out of the drawing) when empty. code:
   EMF_CONTENT_OK every item drawn or current (or no items), EMF_CONTENT_ITEMS_FAILED some items failed,
   EMF_CONTENT_RUN_FAILED the game's archive or types could not be read (every good item failed),
   EMF_CONTENT_BAD_REQUEST not JSON, no game_dir, or no full cache_dir. A cut reply has "items": []. */
