# EMF on a dedicated server

EMF runs inside the official Enshrouded Dedicated Server (`enshrouded_server.exe`, Steam app 2278520) the same way it
runs in the game: the server loads EMF's `dinput8.dll`, EMF loads its mods. Server-side mods change the world for every
player on it, whether or not they have EMF themselves. Players with the right to do so can type EMF commands into the
game's chat.

## Install

1. Stop the server.
2. Run `install.cmd` from the EMF zip with the server's folder (the one with `enshrouded_server.exe`):
   `install.cmd "D:\EnshroudedServer"`, or drag the folder onto `install.cmd`.
3. Start the server. Its window shows EMF's lines (`[EMF] ...`) next to its own; the full log is
   `emf\emf_core.log` in the server folder.

`uninstall.cmd "D:\EnshroudedServer"` removes it again. The server must use the same game version EMF knows
(`tools\emf_sigcheck.exe "D:\EnshroudedServer\enshrouded_server.exe"` checks it without starting anything).

**With EMF.exe:** the folder list at the top of EMF.exe has "Add a server folder..." (the Steam server is found by
itself; a SteamCMD folder is chosen by hand). For a server folder EMF.exe shows its mods with where each has to run,
and a Server tab: the server's name, slots, port and user groups (passwords only as "set"), the chat settings below,
Start and Stop (a clean stop, as Ctrl+C in its window: the server saves first; closing its window is not the same,
Windows ends it about 5 s later and a longer save is cut), "Install EMF" with this installer's own rules, and the server's
log and `emf_core.log` as they grow (EMF's docs/app.md, "Servers", has the details).

## What runs on a server

- Mods that change the world (stacks, villagers, loot, mod programs, events, Lua mods) work as in a game you host.
- The server builds its world within a second of starting; EMF holds its start (about a second) until the mods are
  loaded, so their programs and events are part of that world. `emf\emf_loader.log` says how long.
- So on the server, mods load before the server exe's own start-up code runs (EMF's loader holds the exe's entry
  point until EMF has started): in `emf_mod_load` (and a Lua mod's main chunk) the game's globals are not set up yet.
  Register hooks, programs, events and callbacks there, and read game data only from world callbacks (`on_tick`...).
- The server has no screen: the console overlay, HUD lines, the wheel and notes do nothing there (notes go to the log).
  A mod written for the screen loads but shows nothing.
- `emf.local_player()` is 0: there is no local player. Commands act on the player who typed them (below).
- Commands from the server owner: write them into `emf\commands.txt` (one per line); EMF runs them and writes the
  replies to the log.

## Commands from players' chat

A player types `/help`, `/give wood logs 20` (item names as `/items wood` lists them, typed the easy way: see
[reference.md](reference.md#console-commands-built-in)) or any EMF command
(`/<mod>.<command>` for a mod's own) into the game's chat. EMF runs it, nobody else sees the line, and the replies
come back as chat lines that only that player sees, with no name in front, the way the game shows a player joining:
`[EMF] gave 20 x Material_T1_Wood_Logs to player 1`. At most 10 lines per command; the
server log has the rest. "You" in a command (`give`, `pos`, `spawn`) is the player who typed it: EMF finds their
player by the account hash the chat line carries. If a command answers "player position unknown" or "player
unknown", EMF could not tell which player you are; commands with an explicit target still work. The results of `put`
and `take` come one server step later and reach the chat the same way. (Tested on a dedicated server, except the chat
results of `put` and `take`.)

A player who has EMF installed in their own game can use the server's commands too: in a game someone else hosts,
EMF's chat box leaves `/command` lines alone and they go to the server.

Who may: nobody until you say so, in `emf\emf_core.ini` of the server folder:

```ini
[chat]
; account hashes of the players who may run EMF commands, comma-separated
admins=0x0123456789abcdef, 0xfedcba9876543210
; everyone=1 lets every player run them (only on a server for friends)
everyone=0
```

To find your account hash, type an EMF command for admins (`/pos`) into the chat: EMF answers that you may not, and
the server log says `chat command refused from account 0x...`. Put that value into `admins`, then restart the server.
Or write `chat.players` into `emf\commands.txt` while you are on the server: the log lists every player with their
account hash (EMF API v19).

**Commands for every player** (EMF API v17): mods can mark commands that any player may run, without being in
`admins`: `/help` (it lists only what that player may run), `/raids.status`, `/loot.toggle`, `/loot.status`,
`/champion.where`, `/champion.stats`, `/life_skills.skills`, `/qs`, `/quick_stack`, `/qs.chests`, `/bounty.board`,
`/bounty.take`, `/bounty.drop`, `/bounty.claim`, `/bounty.reroll`, `/bounty.top`, `/grave.where`, `/grave.claim`, `/sleep.status`, and with
Hand-over on `/handover`, `/handover.who`, `/handover.to`, `/handover.block`, with Server Herald on `/players`,
`/playtime`, `/motd`, with Waypoint Teleports on `/unstuck`, `/home`, with Bulk Craft on `/craft`, `/craft.stop`,
`/craft.list`, with Beastmaster on `/beastmaster` (`list`, `tame`, `feed`, `call`, `dismiss`, `attack`), with Necromancer
on `/necromancer` (`raise`, `spirits`, `attack`, `gather`, `dismiss`, `list`). Such commands only
read or act on the player who typed them. `everyone=1` is not needed for those; it opens every command (`give`, `spawn`...) to everyone.
A player who is no admin may send at most 5 commands in 10 seconds: the next one is answered "too many commands", the
rest of those 10 seconds are dropped without a reply (admins are not limited). At most 256 players' lines wait for the
server's next step; more are answered "too many commands are waiting". In the chat `/help` comes in pages of 8
(`/help 2`, ...).

To take a command for players away from players who are no admins, list it in `deny` (commas or spaces):

```ini
[chat]
deny=loot.toggle, champion.where
```

**Defaults of the shipped mods on a server:** Night Raids is on, but every world starts without raids (`raids.world
on`); Loot Magnet, Wandering Champion, Bounty Board, Grave Keeper, Sleep Through the Day, Server Herald, Hand-over,
Waypoint Teleports, Bulk Craft, Flame Blessings, Beastmaster and Necromancer are installed switched off: set `enabled=1` in
`emf\config\<id>.ini` (`loot_magnet`, `champion`, `bounty`, `grave`, `sleep`, `herald`, `handover`, `teleports`,
`bulk_craft`, `blessings`, `beastmaster`, `necromancer`; section `[<id>]`), or switch
them on in EMF.exe, then restart the server. Quick Stack's
chest machines work on a server too: an admin marks chests with `/qs.mark sort` (the nearest chest within 3 m); its
recyclers stay off until `recycler=1`. A
mod marks a command with `register_command_ex` and `EMF_COMMAND_PLAYERS` (C++: `emf::add_command(name, help, f,
EMF_COMMAND_PLAYERS)`; Lua: `emf.command(name, help, fn, {players = true})`; [reference.md](reference.md), v17).
A Steam64 id (17 digits) is not an account hash: an entry that is not one is skipped, with a warning in the log.
EMF.exe's Server tab edits the same `[chat]` keys (admins one per line, the file's other keys and comments kept) and
lists the accounts the log says were refused, each with "Add as admin".

**Waypoint Teleports on a server:** every player may type `/unstuck` and `/home` (a 3 s countdown standing still,
then the teleport; cooldowns, no `/home` from inside the shroud). An admin moves players with `tp #k #m` (player k to
player m: this one works from the server's console, as `tp.pos #k x y z [ground]` and `tp.back #k` do), `bring #k` (to
the admin in the chat) and `tp.list` (who is `#k`). The server moves the player (EMF API v20 `teleport`, the game's own
teleport); the player's game needs nothing and snaps to the new place. The countdown, cancels and results reach each
player as chat lines only they see (API v19 `chat_tell`); admins may name players by name (`tp Ember`), or by `#k` when
two share a name.
Details: [mods/teleports/README.md](../../mods/teleports/README.md).

Text chat must be on in the server's `enshrouded_server.json` (`"enableTextChat": true`).

### Chat lines from mods (EMF API v19)

Mods can write into the game's chat and read it, where players' chat is on (a dedicated server; a game you host with
`[chat] players=1`):

- **A line for one player** (`chat_tell`, Lua `emf.tell`) reaches only that player, outside any command, and shows under
  their own name (`Ember: [Server] Welcome!`). With `EMF_CHAT_SYSTEM` (`chat_tell_ex`, Lua `{system = true}`) it shows
  with no name (`[Server] Welcome!`), as command replies do; a label is only a prefix in the text. In a game you host, a
  line for the host becomes a note at the top of the host's screen.
- **A line for everyone** (`chat_broadcast`, Lua `emf.broadcast`): each player sees it under their own name, or with
  no name with `EMF_CHAT_SYSTEM` (`chat_broadcast_ex`, Lua `{system = true}`). Lines with no name show even when the
  server has text chat off.
- **Players' lines** (`on_chat`, Lua `emf.on_chat`): every chat line a player sends that is no EMF command reaches the
  mods that ask, read-only (a chat log, a Discord mirror).
- **A save now** (`request_save`, Lua `emf.request_save`): the world save the game makes every 30 s, at once.

At most 10 lines per call and 30 lines per mod in 10 seconds (each Lua mod 30); the server log has every line EMF
sends. The shipped
**Server Herald** (`mods/herald`, off by default) uses all of them: a message of the day, join and leave lines,
announcements, a restart countdown (`herald.restart 10 nightly` in `emf\commands.txt`), a chat log per day in
`emf\logs\`, playtime, and an opt-in Discord webhook. **Hand-over** (`mods/handover`, Lua, off by default) lets
players give items to each other with `/handover`; a player who does not want any types `/handover.block`.

### In a game you host

Your own `/commands` already work from your chat (the client side, `[overlay] chat=1`). To let your friends run
commands in a game you host, add `players=1` to the `[chat]` section of your game's `emf\emf_core.ini`; the same
`admins`/`everyone` rules apply, and commands for every player work for every player.

Players allowed to run commands can also run `profile load <name>` (mod profiles, [docs/app.md](../app.md#profiles)):
it switches the mods of this folder for the next start, as `set <mod> enabled 0` already can. With `everyone=1` that
is every player.

## World settings while the server runs

`world.set <setting> <value>` changes a setting of `enshrouded_server.json`'s `"gameSettings"` (day length, loot,
XP, enemy damage, weather...) while the server runs, from the server console, `emf\commands.txt` or the chat of a
`[chat] admins` account (`/world.set night_minutes 5`). Every player gets the new value within a second or two, and
players who join later get it too. It lasts until the server restarts; `world.set ... persist` keeps it for this
world. `world.export` prints a `gameSettings` block to paste into `enshrouded_server.json`; EMF never edits that
file. The settings, their ranges and the other `world.*` commands: [world_settings.md](world_settings.md).

## Players' mods (the mod check on join)

When a player whose game runs EMF 0.6.3 or newer joins a server or a game someone hosts with EMF 0.6.3 or newer, the
two compare the mods that must match: every EML content mod (it changes the game's data) and every mod whose
`mod.json` says `"side": "both"`, by id and version. Mods marked `"server"` or `"client"`, and mods without `side`,
are not compared.

- The player's game shows a note when it lacks one of those mods or has another version, once per session: "Missing
  mods for this server (items from them can be lost): beasts_pack 2.2.0 (you: none). Install the same versions with
  EMF.exe." (at most 3 mods by name; a player missing a content mod would see its items as [Invalid Item Stack]). Its
  console log has the whole list.
- The server writes one line per player to `emf\emf_core.log` (`mods check: player 0x... (entity 2, EMF 0.6.3):
  missing: ...`), and `players.mods` (the server's console, `emf\commands.txt`, or a `[chat] admins` account) lists
  every player in the world: their EMF and what differs, or "no EMF" (a player without EMF cannot be checked).
- By default it only warns. A server owner can refuse such players instead: `[net] mods_check=refuse` in
  `emf\emf_core.ini` (or the Players' mods card on EMF.exe's Server tab), read when the server starts. A player whose
  game lacks a required mod or has another version of one, or has no EMF or an older one (no mod list 60 s after they
  are in the world), is told why in the chat ("[EMF] This server needs these mods: beasts_pack 2.2.0 (you: none).
  Get them from ... You will be disconnected in 5 seconds."), and 5 s later the game's own kick disconnects them (the
  game's "kicked" popup). Nothing is banned: they can come back once they have the mods.
  - Required: the content and side-both mods above, plus the ids in `[net] mods_required = beastmaster, hudmod`
    (the server's version when it runs that mod, any version when it does not).
  - `[net] mods_info` is the "Get them from ..." text (at most 200 bytes); without it an EMF player reads "Install
    them with EMF.exe."
  - Never refused: the host's own player, the server's admins (a user group with `canKickBan`) and the accounts in
    `[chat] admins`. The server logs each refusal and kick; `players.mods` shows who was refused.
  - Refusing needs the game's kick on this game build and the greeting on; otherwise the log says it is off and
    players are only warned.
- The greeting: a server greets new connections (the line a game without EMF shows, at most twice) when one of its
  mods talks to players' games, when it has mods its players must match, or when it refuses players (above). A
  server whose mods players do not need stays silent, and then has nothing to compare (`players.mods` shows "no EMF"
  for everyone there). `[net] greet=0` in `emf\emf_core.ini` switches the greeting, and with it the check, off.
- It travels as the core's own message channel `emf/mods` (version 1); an older EMF at either end takes no part.

## Keeping a test server private

The server registers in Steam's public server list when it starts; there is no unlisted mode. For a private server:

- Do not forward its port (UDP 15637) on your router; when Windows asks about the firewall on the first start, allow
  nothing (untick both boxes). Windows may already have rules that allow `enshrouded_server.exe` (from an earlier
  start): see "Allow an app through Windows Firewall".
- Give every user group in `enshrouded_server.json` a long password: a group with an empty password lets anyone in.
- Join it from the same PC: Play, Join, "Show dedicated server", "Search by IPv4" `127.0.0.1:15637`.
