# Lua mods: start here

A Lua mod is a folder with two text files. No compiler, no Visual Studio: write the files, start the game, and change
them while the game runs; EMF reloads a Lua mod within a second of you saving it.

Lua mods need the `lua` mod (in the EMF zip, on by default): without it (missing, switched off or failed) a Lua mod
and every mod that depends on it do not run, and the Mods tab says why. They run on the same EMF API as C++ mods, with
the same rules: gameplay changes happen on the **host** (your own game, or the game you host).

## Your first Lua mod (five minutes)

The quickest start is the starter in the EMF zip: copy `template_lua\` into `<game>\emf\mods\` and follow
[first_mod.md](first_mod.md) (a line on screen, a key, one setting of each kind, in 10 minutes). Or by hand:

1. Make a folder `<game>\emf\mods\hello_lua\`.
2. Put `mod.json` into it:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "hello_lua",
     "name": "Hello Lua",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "emf": 14,
     "main": "main.lua",
     "depends": {"lua": ">=1.1"}
   }
   ```

   (`lua` 1.1 is the Lua host that has `emf.on_world_data`, `emf.save_world_data` and `world:account`; a mod that uses
   none of them can depend on `>=1.0`. 1.2 also takes full type names such as `keen::ecs::HitEvent`, and
   `emf.command` returns true or false. 1.3 adds `emf.on_key` and `emf.key_down`, and `emf.hud` takes a corner name
   and a `#rrggbb` colour: depend on `">=1.3"` for those. 1.4 adds `emf.time_of_day`, `emf.kill`, a level and rarity
   for `emf.put`, and commands for every player (`emf.command(..., {players = true})`): depend on `">=1.4"`. 1.5 adds
   `emf.health`, `emf.attribute`, `emf.attribute_add` and `emf.damage` (the host needs EMF API v18): depend on
   `">=1.5"`. 1.6 adds `emf.tell`, `emf.broadcast`, `world:name`, `emf.on_chat` and `emf.request_save` (EMF API
   v19), and `emf.command(emf.id, ...)` makes the bare command `/<id>`: depend on `">=1.6"`. 1.7 adds `emf.teleport`
   (EMF API v20): depend on `">=1.7"`. 1.8 adds `world:template`: depend on `">=1.8"`. 1.9 adds wheel groups (`emf.wheel_section`, `emf.wheel_group`): depend on `">=1.9"`. 1.10 adds
   `emf.world_settings` and `emf.on_world_setting_changed` (EMF API v21): depend on `">=1.10"`. 1.11 adds a
   player's XP and level (`emf.xp_required`, `emf.level_cap`, `emf.set_level` and the attribute names `"xp_pending"`,
   `"xp"`, `"xp_required"`, `"level"`; EMF API v22): depend on `">=1.11"`. 1.12 adds `emf.add_component`,
   `emf.remove_component` (EMF API v23) and components spawned with `emf.spawn`: depend on `">=1.12"`. 1.13 adds
   mod windows (`emf.window`, `emf.window_update`, `emf.window_close`; EMF API v24): depend on `">=1.13"`. 1.14 adds
   E prompts (`emf.offer`, `emf.spawn_offer`, `emf.offer_remove`; EMF API v25): depend on `">=1.14"`. 1.15 adds
   pictures in windows (`emf.image`, the `image`, `icon`, `fps` and `height` row fields; EMF API v26): depend on
   `">=1.15"`. 1.17 adds the inter-mod message bus (`emf.bus.subscribe`, `.publish`, `.unsubscribe`): mods using it
   depend on `"lua": ">=1.17"`. 1.18 adds `emf.json` (encode and decode tables as JSON text, for messages on the bus): depend on `">=1.18"`. 1.19 adds mod messages (`emf.net`; EMF API v27): depend on `">=1.19"`. 1.20 adds player events (`emf.on_player_joined`, `_left`, `_died`; EMF API v28): depend on `">=1.20"`. 1.21 adds the game's item names and language (`emf.item_name`, `emf.language`; EMF API v29): depend on `">=1.21"`. 1.22 adds `world:character_name` and the `{system = true}` option of `emf.tell` and `emf.broadcast` (EMF API v30): depend on `">=1.22"`. 1.23 adds hits (`emf.on_hit`, `emf.hit_rule`, `emf.hit_rule_remove`; EMF API v31): depend on `">=1.23"`. 1.24 adds buffs (`emf.buff_types`, `emf.buff_type`, `emf.buffs`, `emf.apply_buff`, `emf.remove_buff`, `emf.on_buff`; EMF API v32): depend on `">=1.24"`. 1.25 adds markers (`emf.marker`, `emf.send_marker` and more; EMF API v33): depend on `">=1.25"`. 1.26 adds the map (`emf.map_cursor`, `emf.on_map_click`, `emf.map_action`, `emf.remove_map_action`, `emf.ground_at`; EMF API v34): depend on `">=1.26"`. 1.27 adds canvases and a minimap's parts (`emf.player_view`, `emf.fog_at`, `emf.map_markers`, `emf.canvas`, `emf.canvas_draw`, the marker key `minimap`, and a `fog` argument for `emf.ground_at`; EMF API v35): depend on `">=1.27"`. 1.28 adds `emf.remove_building` (EMF API v36): depend on `">=1.28"`. 1.29 adds `emf.path_find` and `emf.path_cancel` (EMF API v37): depend on `">=1.29"`. 1.30 adds `emf.door`, `emf.door_open`, `emf.door_close` and `emf.door_lock` (EMF API v38): depend on `">=1.30"`. 1.31 adds a `water_y` argument for `emf.ground_at` (EMF 0.6.8): depend on `">=1.31"`. 1.32 adds enemy orders (`emf.enemy_order`, `emf.enemy_order_cancel`, `emf.enemy_target`; EMF API v39): depend on `">=1.32"`. Ranges are explained in
   [guide.md](guide.md), "Dependencies and version ranges".)

3. Put `main.lua` next to it:

   ```lua
   emf.log("hello from Lua")

   emf.command("where", ": where am I?", function(world, args)
     local x, y, z = world:position(emf.local_player())
     emf.reply(string.format("you are at %.1f, %.1f, %.1f", x, y, z))
   end)

   emf.on_tick(function(world)
     if world:is_client() then
       emf.hud("clock", "Lua says hi", 2)  -- bottom left
     end
   end)
   ```

4. Start the game and load a world. "Lua says hi" shows in the bottom left; open the console (the key under Esc) and
   type `hello_lua.where`. Now change the text in `main.lua` and save: within a second the game shows "Lua mod
   hello_lua reloaded" and the new text.

`emf\mods\kill_counter\` is a complete example (it counts your kills): read it, then copy the folder under a new id
(and change `"id"` in its `mod.json`) to change it. Installing EMF again replaces `kill_counter` itself. It is installed
switched off: switch it on in the Mods tab to see it count.

## What happens when a script fails

A script error or an endless loop does not crash or freeze the game. EMF runs every piece of Lua protected:

- An error stops that call, the log gets `[hello_lua] hello_lua/main.lua:12: attempt to ...` and a note shows on
  screen. The mod is **paused**: its callbacks stop until you save one of its files again, then it reloads.
- A call that runs longer than 250 ms (an endless loop) is stopped the same way, with the line it was running;
  `pcall` cannot catch that stop. The time `emf.save_world_data` spends writing (a slow disk) does not count, up to
  1 s per call.
- A Lua mod may use up to 256 MB of memory. Past that the call fails with "not enough memory" and the mod is paused
  the same way.
- `require` loads `.lua` files from the mod's own folder. Only Lua source runs: precompiled chunks are refused.
- Gone: `os.exit`, `os.execute`, `io.popen`, native modules (`package.loadlib`) and the `debug` library (except
  `debug.traceback`).

This protects the game from mistakes, not your PC from a malicious mod: a Lua mod can read, write and delete files
like any program. Install mods only from people you trust.

`lua.status` in the console lists every Lua mod and whether it runs or why it is paused; `lua.reload` checks the files
right away.

## The `emf` table

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `emf.id` | your mod's id |
| `emf.dir` | your mod's folder (for your own data files) |
| `emf.log(...)` / `print(...)` | a line in `emf\emf_core.log` (and the console), prefixed `[id]` |
| `emf.notify(text)` | a note at the top of the screen for a few seconds |
| `emf.hud(id, text [, place [, rgba]])` | a line kept on screen; `""` removes it; place `"top_right"` (below the quest tracker), `"bottom_right"` or `"bottom_left"` (or 0, 1, 2), so a `select` setting's value fits; `rgba` a `color` setting's `"#rrggbb"`, `"#rrggbbaa"` (with alpha: a line can fade), a number like `0xFFD070FF` or the text `"0xFFD070FF"`; 0 (or none) means the usual colour; the player can move, scale and hide each place in the HUD editor |
| `emf.on_tick(fn)` | `fn(world)` after every world step (server, client). In a game you host, a client step leaves your mod out while it is still busy in the server step (at most 30 steps in a row), so the game's frame seldom waits for your server work (it still does when your mod has a client bus callback with messages due, a client `on_event`, or after 30 steps); keep heavy work in the server world |
| `emf.bus.subscribe(topic, fn [, world])` | (1.17) listen for a topic in `"server"` (default) or `"client"` world; `fn(world, source_mod_id, payload)` runs on that world's next step when a publication arrives; true when registered |
| `emf.bus.publish(topic, payload [, world])` | (1.17) queue a copy of a text/binary payload for `"server"` (default) or `"client"`; true when queued, false if the topic, payload or queue limit is invalid (logged once per rejection streak) |
| `emf.bus.unsubscribe(topic)` | (1.17) remove all this mod's callbacks for a topic in both worlds; true if any were removed, false if none existed |
| `emf.json.encode(value)` | (1.18) a Lua value as JSON text; nil plus a message when it cannot be written (see "JSON (1.18)") |
| `emf.json.decode(text)` | (1.18) JSON text as a Lua value; nil plus a message when the text is not valid JSON |
| `emf.json.null` | (1.18) the value `decode` gives for JSON `null` and `encode` writes as `null` (a Lua table cannot hold nil) |
| `emf.on_event(name, fn [, "server"/"client"])` | `fn(world, event)` for each engine event `name`, with its fields as a table (see below); call it at the top of `main.lua` |
| `emf.command(name, help, fn [, {players = true}])` | a console command `<id>.<name>` (1.6: a `name` that is exactly your mod's id is the command `<id>` itself); `fn(world, args)` (`args` is a table of words); answer with `emf.reply(text)`. The full name is 1-32 letters, digits, `_ . -` (with `<id>.`) and ignores case; another name is not added: false and a log line, the rest of the mod runs. `{players = true}` (1.4): every player may run it from the game's chat, not only the `[chat] admins` ([server.md](server.md)); use it for commands that read or act on their sender (`emf.sender()`). A reload can add or take off the mark. Write `help` as `<args>: what it does` (`"<name>: call a beast"`, `": your life skills"`): the console shows it as players type and offers `a\|b` choices and item names for an `<item>` argument |
| `emf.local_player()` | your player's entity id |
| `emf.sender()` | inside a command: who typed it, `{chat, entity, account, admin}` (`chat` true: another player in the game's chat, `entity` 0 if unknown, `account` a text "0x" + 16 hex digits, `admin` (1.4) true when they may run every command: the console, the host, `[chat] admins`); the host's own chat and the console give `chat` false; nil outside commands |
| `emf.session()` | a number that changes when a world loads (entity ids from an older session mean nothing) |
| `emf.on_world_data(fn)` / `emf.save_world_data(text)` / `emf.player_data(a)` / `emf.save_player_data(a, text)` | your data for the world being played: `fn(world, text)` once after the world loaded / save text for it; (1.20) a text per player (see "Saving data") |
| `emf.setting(key)` | one of your settings from `mod.json`: a `bool` as true/false, `int` and whole `slider` as an integer, `float` and decimal `slider` as a number, `choice` as its index, `select` as the option's value (text), `color` as `"#rrggbb"`, `keybind` as the key's name (`""`: none), `text` as text; players change them in the Mods tab and EMF.exe |
| `emf.set_setting(key, value)` / `emf.on_setting_changed(fn)` | change one / `fn(key)` after each change |
| `emf.item(name)` / `emf.item_info(id)` | an item's id by its debug name (`items wood` in the console lists names) / `{id, name, max_stack, guid}`; inside callbacks only (they need a world), so look ids up in your first `on_tick` or command |
| `emf.item_name(item [, "game"])` / `emf.language()` | (1.21) the name the game shows for an item (an id or a debug name), in the player's language: `name, true`; `debug_name, false` where the game has none (the dedicated server, before its text is known, an older core); `nil, false` for an unknown item. For EMF's screens (windows, wheels, HUD lines) a name EMF's fonts cannot draw comes in English (Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Thai until EMF found a font for them, README_EMF.md); `"game"` gives the player's language always (for the chat). Inside callbacks only / `"en_us"`, `"de_de"`, ... or nil (reference.md "v29") |
| `emf.give(world, player, item, count)` | drops items at a player; `item` is an id or a name |
| `emf.put(world, entity, item, count [, fn] [, {level = n, rarity = r}])` | puts items straight into an inventory; `fn(world, added)` one step later. The table (1.4, before or after `fn`): an item level for gear and a rarity, 0-4 or `"common"`, `"uncommon"`, `"rare"`, `"epic"`, `"legendary"` (without them: the game's defaults) |
| `emf.take(world, entity, item, count [, fn] [, {slot = id, exact = true}])` | takes items out (all or nothing); `fn(world, taken)`. The table (1.6): `slot` an InventorySlotId (the inventory entity in the low 32 bits, the slot index 0-7 above: `inv | (i << 32)`) to take from first; with `exact = true` only from that slot (never another inventory, such as worn equipment). Taken items your callback does not hand on (it raises an error first, or the script paused or reloaded before the answer) go back into `entity` |
| `emf.move(world, from, to, item, count [, opts] [, fn])` | (1.6) moves items without losing any: take, put, give back, drop; `opts`: `slot`, `exact`, `fallback`, `level`, `rarity`; `fn(world, moved, returned, dropped, taken)`. true when started (see "Moving items" below) |
| `emf.spawn(world, guid, x, y, z [, components])` / `emf.destroy(world, id)` | spawns a template at a position in metres / removes an entity (host only). 1.12: `components` = `{Name = {field = value}, ...}` are spawned with the entity (at most 15, by their real field names, absent fields 0; not `CurrentTransform`): `emf.spawn(w, guid, x, y, z, {ScaleComponent = {uniformScale = 1.25}})` makes a creature drawn 1.25x as big (a `ScaleComponent` from 0.1 to 10). An unknown name or field is an error. On a placed object `destroy` gives no item back, drops no loot and plays no pick-up sound; a container's contents go with it. Never destroy a Flame Altar (the base). For a pick-up use `emf.remove_building` (1.28); for loot use `emf.damage` on a `Destructible` object |
| `emf.remove_building(world, id [, opts])` | 1.28: removes a placed object like a pick-up, item back; `true, item_id` or `false, reason`; options below |
| `emf.path_find(world, from, to [, opts], fn)` | 1.29: asks the game's path grid for a path, `fn(world, result, points)` comes later; id or nil; options below |
| `emf.path_cancel(id)` | 1.29: cancels an open path query; true when it was open |
| `emf.door(world, id)` | 1.30: `"open"` or `"closed"` plus `{locked = bool, logic = bool}`, or nil when not a door (see "Doors" below) |
| `emf.door_open(world, id [, "front" \| "back"])` / `emf.door_close(world, id)` | 1.30: opens / closes a door at the next step; true when it will change, false when refused |
| `emf.door_lock(world, id, locked)` | 1.30: no E prompt on the door while locked (not saved); true / false |
| `emf.enemy_order(world, enemy, target [, opts])` | 1.32: the enemy goes for the target (a door, a gate, a creature, a player); the order's id, or nil and why (see "Enemy orders" below) |
| `emf.enemy_order_cancel(id)` / `emf.enemy_target(world, enemy)` | 1.32: end an order / what the enemy goes for now (or nil) |
| `emf.kill(world, id)` | (1.4) kills a creature without a hit: its current health becomes 0 (1.5: through the game's attribute code) and the game's death program sends `EntityDiedEvent` the next step; the corpse keeps its loot. No attacker, no kill credit (`emf.damage` gives one); never a player; host only. true / false |
| `emf.health(world, id)` | (1.5) the current and maximum health: `local cur, max = emf.health(w, id)`; the game's attributes in a world you host, else the replicated `NetworkHealth`; nil when neither is there |
| `emf.attribute(world, id, attr)` | (1.5) an attribute as the game reads it: `attr` is `"health"`, `"max_health"`, `"stamina"`, `"max_stamina"`, `"mana"`, `"max_mana"`, a player's `"xp_pending"`, `"xp"`, `"xp_required"` and `"level"` (1.11, EMF API v22), or an attribute id; nil when the entity has none. Give XP with `emf.attribute_add(w, player, "xp_pending", n)`: the game levels the player up itself (the other three are read-only). Host only |
| `emf.attribute_add(world, id, attr, delta)` | (1.5) adds `delta` (a whole number) through the game's own attribute code: damage stops at 0, a heal of `"health"`, `"stamina"` or `"mana"` at its maximum (other heals are refused). Not a hit: no kill credit, no hit reaction. Host only. true / false |
| `emf.damage(world, attacker, target, amount)` | (1.5) `amount` of true damage as a real game hit on the next step: a `HitEvent` (damage numbers, always a light reaction, aggro toward the attacker), the killing blow, kill credit and XP for `attacker` when it is a player (0 = no attacker, no aggro). The target must take hits (creatures and players, and since 1.23 placed objects: see "Hits" below) and not be immune. Host only. true / false |
| `emf.xp_required(world, level)` | (1.11) the XP `level` needs before the next one (the game's own curve); nil outside 1..cap or when unknown. Host only |
| `emf.level_cap(world)` | (1.11) the highest level a player can reach; nil when unknown. Host only |
| `emf.set_level(world, player, level [, xp])` | (1.11) sets a player's level (1..cap) with `xp` (default 0) towards the next one: raises or lowers at once, without level-up events (to level up the game's way, give XP with `emf.attribute_add(w, player, "xp_pending", n)`). The skill points follow the level; after lowering, a skill tree that costs more points than the level gives is reset by the game at the next load. Saved with the character. Host only. true (done or queued) / false |
| `emf.add_component(world, id, name [, data] [, opts] [, fn])` | (1.12) adds component `name` to entity `id` through the game's own command, with `data` = `{field = value}` by the real field names (absent fields are 0; pass `nil` for `data` to give `opts` or `fn` without it). In this version only `ScaleComponent` (`uniformScale` from 0.1 to 10) and `InteractionPause`; the components the world save keeps are refused until checked in game ([reference.md](reference.md), "v23"). A `ScaleComponent` added this way is not drawn (the game reads the size when it makes the creature): spawn with it instead (`emf.spawn`'s `components`). Only when absent: one already there is never overwritten. Never a player. Applied two server steps later; `fn(world, status, why)` then runs once: `status` is `"done"`, `"already"` or `"failed"` (not called when the world ends first). An unknown name or field is an error. Host only. true (queued) / false (refused: see the log; `fn` is not called) |
| `emf.remove_component(world, id, name [, opts] [, fn])` | (1.12) removes component `name` from entity `id`: one this mod added in this session (`ScaleComponent`, `InteractionPause`). `fn` as above (`"already"`: it was not there). Host only. true / false |
| `emf.tell(world, id, text [, opts])` | (1.6) a chat line only player `id` sees, under their own name (in a game you host, a note for the host itself); (1.22) `opts` `{system = true}`: shown with no name, like the game's "joined" lines, also with text chat off (a label only as a prefix: `"[Raid] ..."`; an older core shows it under the player's name); `"\n"` splits lines, at most 10. Where players' chat is on: a dedicated server, or `[chat] players=1` in a game you host ([server.md](server.md)). A Lua mod may send 30 lines in 10 s. true when queued, false when refused (the log says why) |
| `emf.broadcast(text [, opts])` | (1.6) the same line for every connected player (a note for the host of a game you host); (1.22) `opts` as `emf.tell`. true / false |
| `emf.on_chat(fn)` | (1.6) `fn(world, account, entity, text)` for every chat line a player sends that is not an EMF command, on the server world after its next step; `account` as text ("0x" + 16 hex digits), `entity` 0 when unknown. Read-only: the line is shown as usual. false where players' chat is off |
| `emf.request_save()` | (1.6) asks the game to save the world now (the save its 30 s timer makes). Host or dedicated server. true when asked |
| `emf.teleport(world, id, x, y, z [, opts] [, fn])` | (1.7) moves an entity as fast travel does (see "Teleport" below) |
| `emf.world_settings.get(key)`, `.set(key, value [, persist])`, `.reset([key] [, persist])`, `.list()` | (1.10) the running world's settings: day length, loot, XP, enemy damage... (see "World settings" below). Host or dedicated server |
| `emf.on_world_setting_changed(fn)` | (1.10) `fn(key, value)` once per world setting the server wrote, whoever changed it, on the server world after that step. false on an older core |
| `emf.time_of_day([world])` | (1.4) the time of day in hours (`19.5` = 19:30) from the world's clock, or nil when it is not known. Inside callbacks only (it needs a world: the callback's, or the one you pass); at the top of `main.lua` it is an error, as `emf.item` is |
| `emf.session_token()` | (1.4) a text that names this run of the game and its hosted session. Save it with entity ids: `emf.session()` restarts at 1 every time the game starts and the ids are renumbered, so only a matching token means the ids still name the same entities |
| `emf.on_key(key, fn [, "server"/"client"])` | `fn(world)` once per press of `key`: one of your `keybind` settings (the player's choice counts, also when changed while the game runs) or a key name (`"F7"`, `"G"`). It runs after the next step of the server world when your game hosts one, else of your client world (or of the kind given). Keys only count while the game window is in front and the console is closed |
| `emf.key_down(key)` | true while the key (or the key in a `keybind` setting) is held |
| `emf.wheel(title, labels, key, fn)` | the radial wheel; `key` is held to choose (`"G"`, `""` for click); `fn(world, choice)`, choice 1..n or nil |
| `emf.wheel_section(group, title, labels, fn)` | (1.9) your part of a wheel shared by several mods: publishes (replaces) your section of `group`; an empty list or nil removes it. `fn(world, index, label)` gets the index into the labels as they were when the wheel opened, and the label shown: if you published another list since, find the item by `label`. A pick from a wheel opened before your mod reloaded is dropped. Publish again when your labels change |
| `emf.wheel_group(group, title, key)` | (1.9) opens one wheel with every mod's section of `group` (each label as "Section: label" when more than one mod has a section); a pick runs only its owner's `fn`. True when it opened (false: no labels, or more than 64) |
| `emf.on_hit(fn [, {kinds = ...}])` | (1.23) `fn(world, hit)` after the server applied each landing hit on an entity (the game's `HitEvent`), on the server world; with `kinds` also fall, shroud, cold and drowning damage; see "Hits" below. Joined players' games see none. true / false (false on an older core) |
| `emf.hit_rule{from, to, crit, backstab, weakspot, types, attack, healing, kinds, scale, add, min_health, cancel}` | (1.23) a rule the core applies to every matching hit before it lands: change its amount or cancel it. Returns its id, or nil when refused (the log says why: 64 rules, the hook not usable on this game build). See "Hits" below |
| `emf.hit_rule_remove(id)` | (1.23) removes a rule of this script. true only for the script's own rule |
| `emf.buff_types(world [, slot])` | (1.24) the game's buff types as a list of type tables; `slot` is `"food"`, `"buff"`, `"debuff"`, `"rested"` or `"terrain"`. Any world. See "Buffs" below |
| `emf.buff_type(world, id)` | (1.24) one type table, or nil |
| `emf.buffs(world, entity)` | (1.24) the entity's active buffs as a list of tables, in slot order. Any world |

### Messages between Lua mods (1.17)

The `emf.bus` table lets separate Lua mods exchange **copies** of messages without sharing their Lua state.
This works on dedicated servers as well as in a hosted game. It does not provide network transport between the
server and clients: `"server"` and `"client"` choose which local world step delivers a message. The default is
`"server"`. A bus-using mod needs `"depends": {"lua": ">=1.17"}` in `mod.json`.

```lua
-- In a second Lua mod (the receiver):
emf.bus.subscribe("example.event", function(world, sender, payload)
  emf.log("received from", sender, payload)
end) -- defaults to the server world

-- In the sender mod:
local ok = emf.bus.publish("example.event", "example-payload")
if not ok then emf.log("message was refused") end
```

`topic` is 1-96 **bytes** (ASCII control characters, including NUL, are refused); `payload` is a Lua string of up to **65,536
bytes** and may contain `\0`. A topic may have several callbacks in one mod. Calling `unsubscribe(topic)` removes
all of them, including server and client callbacks. The callback's `sender` is the source mod's id, not a player id.

Each world delivers accepted messages in **publish order**, on its **next world step**. A publication made *inside*
a bus callback is held for the *following* step, never delivered recursively in the same step. A mod **does receive
its own messages** if subscribed to that topic. During the initial load, a message published by one mod's `main.lua`
can reach another mod even if that receiver's `main.lua` is loaded later, before the first world step. Subscriptions
added at runtime do not consume older publications.

Each publisher may have at most **256** pending messages; all publishers together may have at most **4,096**.
A rejected publication returns `false` and EMF logs the reason once until that mod next publishes successfully.
Messages are held in memory, not saved to disk. On reload, stop or Lua error, a mod's subscriptions
and its pending outgoing messages are cleared. New subscriptions cannot receive messages queued for the previous
load; messages still intended for other subscribed mods are preserved. Handle a refusal by retrying later or
coalescing updates rather than publishing in a tight loop.

### Services on the bus

One mod can offer a *service* that other mods call with request and reply messages (a world database, navigation, ...).
[services.md](services.md) is the short guide: topic names, the JSON envelope, request ids, timeouts, announcing a
service, and the examples `bus_service` and `bus_client`.

### JSON (1.18)

Bus payloads are strings, so a mod that sends a table turns it into text first. `emf.json` does that the same way
for every mod. It needs `"depends": {"lua": ">=1.18"}`.

```lua
local text = emf.json.encode({op = "get", args = {key = "apple"}, tags = {"a", "b"}})
-- {"args":{"key":"apple"},"op":"get","tags":["a","b"]}
local value, err = emf.json.decode(text)
if not value then emf.log("bad json:", err) end
```

Bad input never raises a Lua error: `encode` and `decode` give `nil` and a message, so check the result (a call with
a missing or wrong-typed argument is still a usage error, as for other `emf` functions).

- **Tables**: keys exactly `1..n` (n at least 1) make a JSON array. Any other table is an object and all its keys must
  be strings; a table with other keys (`{1, 2, x = 3}`, a sparse list, a number or table as key) is an error that names
  the problem. An empty table is `{}`, so an empty list decodes and encodes as an object: test `next(t) == nil`.
  Object keys are written in sorted order, so the same table always gives the same text.
- **Numbers**: a Lua integer is written as an integer. A float is written in the shortest form that reads back as the
  same number, and a whole float keeps a `.0` (`3.0`), so it stays a float. NaN and infinity are errors. When reading,
  a number without a fraction or exponent that fits 64 bits is an integer, any other number a float.
- **Null**: `emf.json.null` stands for JSON `null` (in either direction). Compare with `==`. A nil value in a table
  does not exist in Lua, so use `emf.json.null` when "no value" must be sent.
- **Strings** are UTF-8 and are checked: a string with invalid UTF-8 is an error in both directions. Quotes,
  backslashes and control characters are escaped; `\uXXXX` escapes, including surrogate pairs, are decoded; a lone
  surrogate is an error. Other text (`/`, accents, emoji) is written as it is.
- **Also**: `emf.json.null` is truthy (`if value then` is true for null: compare with `== emf.json.null`). Metatables
  are ignored (`__index`, `__pairs` have no effect; only the table's own entries are written). A repeated key in
  the text keeps its last value. A UTF-8 byte order mark at the start of the text is an error. `-0` decodes as the
  integer `0`. `decode` accepts a number as its argument (Lua converts it to text: `decode(5)` is `5`); other
  non-text arguments are a usage error.
- **Booleans** as usual. Functions, threads, userdata (except `emf.json.null`) and `nil` are errors.
- **Limits**: 64 levels of nesting (this also stops a table that contains itself), 1 MiB of input text, 1 MiB of
  output text. The bus carries at most 64 KiB, so encode first and check that `emf.bus.publish` returned true.

### Moving items

`emf.move(world, from, to, item, count [, opts] [, fn])` (1.6) moves items without losing any. It takes `count` from
`from` (all or nothing), puts them into `to`, gives back into `from` what does not fit, and drops what still does not fit
at `from`, else at `to`, else at `opts.fallback`, else at the nearest player (`LOST` in the log only when none of them
can take it).

- `opts`: `slot`, `exact` (as for `emf.take`), `fallback`, `level`, `rarity` (as for `emf.put`).
- `fn(world, moved, returned, dropped, taken)` runs at the end.
- It finishes in the Lua host even when your script errors or reloads meanwhile (only `fn` is skipped then), and does
  nothing with an answer from another session.
- At most 24 moves wait at once (false: try again later). It returns true when started.

### Teleport

`emf.teleport(world, id, x, y, z [, opts] [, fn])` (1.7, EMF API v20) moves a player, villager, animal or creature the
way the game's fast travel does. It returns true when queued, false when refused (the log says why).

- `opts`: `ground = true` (the game's ground search: the nearest walkable spot within about 10 m; when there is none
  the entity stands exactly at x, y, z), `yaw = degrees`, `spawn_point = id` (an entity with `PlayerSpawnPoint`: land
  on its pads as a respawn does; x, y, z may then be nil), `checkpoint = true`, `ready = true`.
- `fn(moved, x, y, z, info, world)` runs after the step that moved it, or when it failed. `x, y, z` is where the entity
  is now. `info` is `{status = "moved"/"failed"/"ready", distance, off_target, raw_target, reason, entity}`.
- With `ready = true`, `fn` runs a second time (`info.status == "ready"`) once a player can play again.
- When the session ends first (a reload of the world, back to the menu) or the script was reloaded meanwhile, `fn` is
  not called.

The rules (what is refused, waits, NPCs) are those of `teleport` in [reference.md](reference.md) (v20).

### World settings

`emf.world_settings` (1.10, EMF API v21) reads and changes the running world's settings, the values of
`enshrouded_server.json`'s `"gameSettings"`. Only where a world is hosted (the host or a dedicated server).

- `get(key)`: the value now, or nil. A key is the setting's name as `enshrouded_server.json` has it
  (`"playerStaminaFactor"`) or its short name (`"loot"`, `"day_minutes"`); durations are in minutes, choices by
  number, on/off as 1/0.
- `set(key, value [, persist])`: true when queued for the next server step (every player gets it); `false, why` when
  refused (`"loot: allowed 0.25 to 2"`, `"unknown setting: x"`, `"no world is hosted here"`). `persist = true`
  keeps it for this world (applied again after each load). A boolean value counts as 1 or 0.
- `reset([key] [, persist])`: back to the world's own value; no key: every setting. `persist` also forgets the kept
  value (`reset(true)` for all).
- `list()`: `{{key, alias, group, type, min, max, value, world, changed, needs_client}, ...}`, empty without a hosted
  world. `type` is `"float"`, `"bool"`, `"enum"`, `"minutes"` or `"whole"`; `world` is the world's own value.

The settings and their ranges are in [world_settings.md](world_settings.md). A mod that changes them should say so
in its README: players expect the world to keep the settings they chose.

## Hits (1.23)

`emf.on_hit(fn)` sees each hit the server world applies to an entity, after it landed. `emf.hit_rule{...}` changes
hits before they land, with no script call in between (a script never runs before a hit lands: the script lock is shared
by the world threads, and a call per hit would slow fights). Both work on the server world only (a game you host or the
dedicated server; see [server.md](server.md)).

`fn(world, hit)` gets a table:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `attacker`, `source` | the root source (the shooter of an arrow, the caster of a spell; 0 = none) and the direct source (a projectile, a trap) |
| `target`, `part` | the actor hit and the entity hit (the same for most hits) |
| `amount` | health damage; negative for healing. A blocked or parried hit has 0 |
| `stamina` | stamina damage of a blocked hit |
| `crit`, `blocked`, `parried`, `backstab`, `weakspot`, `healing`, `killed` | booleans (`killed`: the killing blow; for fall, shroud, cold and drowning: it left no health) |
| `types` | list of damage type names: `"cut"`, `"pierce"`, `"blunt"`, `"fire"`, `"ice"`, `"shroud"`, `"lightning"`, `"poison"`, `"wood"`, `"stone"`, `"metal"`, `"explosion"` |
| `attack`, `attacks` | the attack's kind: `"melee"`, `"ranged"`, `"magic"`, `"tool"`, `"other"`, `"aoe"` or `"skillshot"` (nil for a `emf.damage` hit); `attacks` lists every kind the hit has (most have one) |
| `weapon_item`, `weapon_category`, `program`, `impact`, `reaction` | the weapon's item id (0 = none or not known), the game's weapon category hash, the attack's impact program, the swing or projectile (hits of one share it), the hit reaction type |
| `health_before`, `health_after` | the target's health around the hit; nil when not known |
| `kind` | `"hit"` (an entity hit), `"fall"`, `"shroud"`, `"cold"` or `"drowning"`: see "Fall, shroud, cold and drowning" below |
| `instant` | true when the game set health to 0 at once: deadly shroud, or a creature (not a player) out of air |
| `from_mod` | true for a hit made by `emf.damage` |
| `position` | `{x = , y = , z = }` in metres |

A rule takes: `from` and `to` (an entity id, or `"players"`, `"creatures"`, `"objects"`; absent = anyone; an entity id
as `to` matches the actor hit and the part hit), `crit`, `backstab`, `weakspot` (true = only such hits), `types` (a
type name or a list of names, any of them), `attack` (a name or a list of names), `healing` (true = healing hits only; without it
a rule matches damage hits only, so "no PvP" does not stop a friend's heal), then what it does: `cancel` (the hit is
dropped: no damage, number, reaction, aggro, XP credit or destruction), `scale` (amount times scale; a blocked hit's
stamina too), `add` (added after the scale), `min_health` (the target keeps at least that much health: 1 = it cannot
die from hits). A damage hit never becomes a heal and a heal never becomes damage. Rules apply in id order; cancel
wins. An unknown field or a bad name is an error. A script's rules are removed when it reloads, unloads or pauses.

### Fall, shroud, cold and drowning

`kinds` lets a rule or a callback take part in the damage the game does not make as hits. A kind name is `"hit"`,
`"fall"`, `"shroud"`, `"cold"` or `"drowning"`; `kinds` is one name, a list of names, or `"all"`. An unknown name is an
error.

- `emf.hit_rule{kinds = "fall", to = "players", cancel = true}`. Without `kinds` a rule is for entity hits only, so every
  rule keeps its meaning.
- `emf.on_hit(fn, {kinds = {"fall", "drowning"}})`. Without the option `fn` gets entity hits only: a damage meter does
  not get 60 shroud ticks a second unasked.
- `hit.kind` tells them apart. For these kinds `attacker` and `source` are 0, `target` = `part` = the entity, there are no
  `types` or `attack`, and `health_before` and `health_after` are known. `from` (a player or creature) never matches
  them, nor `crit`, `types` or `attack`.
- Fall is once per landing. Shroud, cold and drowning come every server step (about 60 a second) while the shroud timer is
  out, body heat is 0 while freezing, or oxygen is 0. `scale` is exact there (0.5 halves 1-point ticks: EMF carries the
  fraction). `add` is per event, so about 60 times a second on those three.
- `min_health` works on every kind. A cancelled hit never reaches `on_hit` (entity hits too); a cancel gives back no mana or
  stamina the attacker spent. `add` on a healing rule is added to a negative amount: a positive `add` makes the heal smaller. A cancelled fall gives the health back, but the
  game's hard-landing stagger still plays.

What never becomes a hit (no hook sees it): regeneration, direct attribute writes, voxel damage (terrain and walls). A
blocked or parried hit changes stamina, not health.

`emf.damage` also hits placed objects (an entity with `Destructible` and no `CombatFlags`, or with `handleHits` on): the
game gives it health on the first hit and removes it at 0. A placed object's health is not saved: a reload heals it.

Recipes: [cookbook.md](cookbook.md), "Hits".

## Buffs (1.24)

The game's buffs and debuffs (potions, food, Wet, Poisoned, auras). Listing and reading work on any world. Giving and
removing work on the server world only (a game you host or the dedicated server): EMF asks the game's own buff code in
the next step, so every game rule runs (slots, giving again, faction exclusions, the food time factor, effects, the HUD
icon, saving). The answer comes after that step. A joined player's game cannot give or remove. Store type ids, not
names: names repeat ("Burning" is ten types) and change with the language, and the dedicated server has no names. Find
ids with the console command `buffs.list` or `emf.buff_types`. Details: [reference.md](reference.md), "v32: buffs".

`emf.buff_types(world [, slot])` and `emf.buff_type(world, id)` give type tables:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `id` | the buff type id |
| `slot` | `"food"`, `"buff"`, `"debuff"`, `"rested"` or `"terrain"` |
| `name`, `description` | the game's text in the player's language; nil on a dedicated server |
| `hidden` | true when the game does not show it |
| `saved` | true when it stays in the world save (potions, Wet, food) |
| `ends_on_death` | true when it ends with its target (EMF does not check whether the target is alive when it gives one) |
| `seconds` | its default time |
| `apply` | giving it again: `"once"` (refused), `"reset"` (its timer starts again), `"replace"` (a new buff) |
| `follow_up` | the type given when it ends (0 = none) |

`emf.buffs(world, entity)` gives a list of the entity's active buffs, in slot order (at most 40):

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `type`, `name`, `slot` | as above |
| `entity` | the buff's own entity |
| `level` | from its source's level, 0 = none |
| `seconds` | its whole time; nil when not known yet |
| `seconds_left` | the time left; nil when not known yet (the step it was given) |
| `cleansed` | true while it is being removed |

`emf.apply_buff(world, target, type [, opts] [, fn])` and `emf.remove_buff(world, target, type [, fn])` return true when
queued, false when refused at once (the log says why: not the server world, an unknown type, 64 requests waiting, not
available on this game build). `opts`: `seconds` (0 or absent = the type's default), `source` (the entity the buff comes
from, default the target; damage over time scales from the source's stats, so give a creature), `item` (the item type
id a food buff takes its stats and time from, as `emf.item` gives: not an item entity; an unknown id is refused; without
it a food buff likely has no stats). An unknown option is an error.
`fn(world, result)` is called after the step with a result table. At most 16 requests are handled per step.

`result` (and the table `emf.on_buff` gets):

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `"applied"`, `"refreshed"`, `"removed"` or `"refused"` (results are `"applied"`, `"removed"` or `"refused"`) |
| `target`, `type`, `name`, `slot` | the entity, the type, its text (nil on a dedicated server) and its slot |
| `buff_entity` | the buff's own entity (0 when refused) |
| `cleansed` | `"removed"`: true when it was cleansed (always for `emf.remove_buff`; the game's own cleanses when EMF saw the mark); false when it ended or was replaced |
| `replaced` | `"removed"`: true when a new buff of the same type took its place (given again, a replace type); that `"applied"` comes right after |
| `seconds_left` | the time left; nil when not known |
| `why` | `"refused"` only: the reason, for example "the target does not have it" |

Refusal reasons: unknown buff type; the target has no buff container; the type is never given to the target's faction;
the game did not give it (the target's faction could not be read); no free slot of that group; already there and this type
cannot be given again; the target does not have it (remove; also when it is already being removed); not the server world; giving not available on this game build; 64 requests waiting.

`emf.on_buff(fn)`: `fn(world, ev)` after the server step for every change of a **player's** buffs, whoever made it (a
mod, a potion, food, rain, the end of the time). It compares after each step with the step before (a player who just
joined is compared within a quarter second). The first sight of a player (a new world, a join) says nothing.
`"refreshed"`: its end moved later by more than a second. Returns true, or false on an older core.

Recipes: [cookbook.md](cookbook.md), "Buffs".

## Markers (1.25)

Markers over the 3D view and on the game's map, drawn by EMF on each player's game in the game's style. `emf.marker` is
for the game your mod runs in; on a server (a game you host or the dedicated server) `emf.send_marker` puts them on a
player's game, or on everyone's: players need EMF on their game, not your mod. The ids are your mod's own (EMF keeps
them apart from other mods'); your markers go when your mod unloads or reloads, also from the players' games you sent
them to. Details: [reference.md](reference.md), "v33: markers".

```lua
emf.marker("home", {x = 4120, y = 96, z = 7333, text = "Home", game_map = true})
emf.send_marker(player, "pet", {entity = pet, height = 2.2, text = "Bjorn", edge_arrow = true, game_map = true})
emf.send_marker(nil, "raid", {x = 900, y = 40, z = 2100, text = "Raid!", colour = 0xff4040ff, max_distance = 600})
emf.unsend_marker(player, "pet")
```

| Function | What |
|---|---|
| `emf.marker(id, spec)` | sets or updates a marker on this game: true, false where nothing draws (the dedicated server) or when refused (logged) |
| `emf.remove_marker(id)` / `emf.clear_markers()` | removes one (true when it was there) / all of yours (how many) |
| `emf.send_marker(player or nil, id, spec)` | server: on that player's game (their entity), or every player's (nil); how many players it went to |
| `emf.unsend_marker(player or nil, id)` | takes a sent one off again |
| `emf.world_to_screen(x, y, z)` | `px, py` in display pixels, or nil (behind the camera, no frame yet) |
| `emf.marker_types()` | the game's map icon type ids its own map entries used in this world (for `game_icon`) |

`spec` keys (anything else is an error):

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `x`, `y`, `z` | the position in world metres (with `entity`: where it shows until the game knows the entity) |
| `entity` | follow this entity |
| `height` | metres above the position |
| `text` | the label (cut at 64 bytes) |
| `colour` | `0xRRGGBBAA` (default: the HUD's accent colour) |
| `shape` | `"diamond"` (default), `"circle"`, `"square"` or `"none"` (text only) |
| `icon` | a picture from `emf.image` instead of the shape (only with `emf.marker`) |
| `world` | over the 3D view (default true) |
| `distance` | the distance under the text (default true) |
| `game_map` | on the map (default false) |
| `game_icon` | with `game_map`: one of the game's map icons (a type from `emf.marker_types`) instead of the shape |
| `edge_arrow` | an arrow at the screen's edge when it is behind you or off screen (default false) |
| `max_distance` | fades out toward it and is hidden beyond (default: no limit; the map shows it anyway) |
| `minimap` | (1.27) a canvas's `"markers"` item draws it (default false) |

## The map (1.26)

Players can act on the game's world map. `emf.map_cursor` and `emf.on_map_click` are for the game your mod runs in. A
map action is for a server (a game you host or the dedicated server): players hold Shift and the left mouse button on
their map, and your function gets the spot. Players need EMF on their game, not your mod. Details:
[reference.md](reference.md), "v34".

```lua
emf.map_action("height", {label = "Ground height", hold_ms = 800}, function(world, player, x, z, admin)
  emf.ground_at(world, x, z, function(world, ok, gx, gy, gz, why, hop_y)
    if ok then
      emf.tell(world, player, string.format("The ground at %d, %d is %.1f m up.", gx, gz, gy))
    else
      emf.log("no ground at", x, z, why)
    end
  end)
end)
```

| Function | What |
|---|---|
| `emf.map_cursor()` | `x, z` in world metres under the mouse while the map is open, else nil |
| `emf.on_map_click(fn)` | `fn(world, click)` on the client world's next step after a click on the map (Lua never runs on the game window's thread); `click` = `{button = "left" \| "right", shift, ctrl, alt, x, z}`. true when the core listens |
| `emf.map_action(id, opts, fn)` | server: adds a map action. `opts` is nil or `{label = text, hold_ms = number}` (an unknown key is an error). `fn(world, player, x, z, admin)` runs on the server world; `player` is their entity, `admin` is true for the host or an admin. The core id is `"<mod id>:<id>"`. true when taken |
| `emf.remove_map_action(id)` | true when your script had that action |
| `emf.ground_at(world, x, z, fn)` | server world: the ground under the spot. `fn(world, ok, x, y, z, why, hop_y, fog, water_y)` once, a few seconds at most; `hop_y` is a number only when the place is not loaded (nobody is near; teleport a player to that height over it, then ask again), else nil. `fog` (1.27) is the shroud a player standing there would be in: `"none"`, `"removed"`, `"shroud"`, `"deadly"` (a player there dies) or `"unknown"`. `water_y` (1.31): when the spot is under water at least 1 m deep, the water's surface (y stays the ground under it, and `fog` is the worse of the surface and the bed); else nil. true when asked |

Only the first action announced to the players is what Shift + hold does. Your map actions go when your script reloads,
pauses or unloads; your click functions stop then too.

## Canvases and the minimap (1.27)

A canvas is a drawing panel your mod owns. You place it, then hand EMF a list of shapes, and EMF draws it over the HUD
every frame. These functions are for the game your mod runs in (the client); on a dedicated server they do nothing.
Details: [reference.md](reference.md), "v35". The sample minimap in `mods/minimap/` is the full example.

| Function | What |
|---|---|
| `emf.player_view()` | `{x, y, z, heading, camera_yaw, world_size}`, or nil when there is no player yet. Degrees: 0 north (+z), 90 east (+x). `camera_yaw` is nil until a frame of the 3D view was seen. |
| `emf.fog_at(x, z)` | 0 (unexplored) .. 1 (explored) on this game's map, or nil. A copy refreshed twice a second. |
| `emf.map_markers()` | a list of `{type, x, y, z, shown}`: the game's own map markers (altars, shrines, places found). `shown` is true when the game's map shows it. |
| `emf.canvas(id, spec)` | places a canvas. `spec` = `{corner = "top_left" \| "top_right" \| "bottom_left" \| "bottom_right", x, y, w, h, shape = "rect" \| "circle", hidden}`. `x`, `y` are measured from the corner, inward; all sizes are in units of a 1080-pixel-high screen; `w`, `h` are 8 to 1080. `spec` nil removes the canvas. Your canvases go when the script reloads, pauses or unloads (the core id is `"<mod id>:<id>"`). |
| `emf.canvas_draw(id, list)` | the canvas's drawing, replacing the last one. At most 2048 items. |

A list item is a table: the kind first, then numbers, then named options. Positions are in canvas units: 0, 0 is the
top left, `w`, `h` the bottom right. Colours are `0xRRGGBBAA`. An unknown kind is an error.

| Kind | Positional numbers | Named |
|---|---|---|
| `"rect"` | x, y, w, h | `colour`, `width` (0 or none: filled) |
| `"circle"` | cx, cy, r | `colour`, `width` |
| `"line"` | x1, y1, x2, y2 | `colour`, `width` |
| `"tri"` | x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 (filled) | `colour` |
| `"text"` | x, y (the centre), then the text | `colour`, `size` |
| `"image"` | picture (from `emf.image`), x, y, w, h | `colour` (tint), `turn` (degrees) |
| `"fog"` | cx, cz, metres per unit | `colour` (the unexplored colour) |
| `"markers"` | cx, cz, metres per unit | |
| `"map"` | cx, cz, metres per unit | |

`fog`, `markers` and `map` take the world x, z at the canvas centre and how many metres one canvas unit is. `"fog"`
draws the fog of war as cells. `"markers"` draws the markers made with `minimap = true` (see "Markers"). `"map"` is
the game's own world map, drawn by the game, so it looks like the map screen (relief, shroud, fog of war). It is north
up: turn your own arrow and icons.

Draw order: the game draws `"map"` before EMF draws anything else. Items before your last `"map"` are under it and are
drawn only when the game cannot draw the map. Put the background first, then `"map"`, then the rest. The game clips its
map to the canvas's rectangle, also for a round canvas. Canvases are hidden where markers are: on the map screen, in
menus and in the console.

```lua
emf.canvas("mini", {corner = "bottom_right", x = 16, y = 64, w = 200, h = 200})
emf.on_tick(function(world)
  if not world:is_client() then return end
  local v = emf.player_view()
  if not v then return end
  emf.canvas_draw("mini", {
    {"rect", 0, 0, 200, 200, colour = 0x14181ce6},
    {"map", v.x, v.z, 2},
    {"circle", 100, 100, 4, colour = 0xffe08aff},
  })
end)
```

## Removing placed objects (1.28)

An object a player placed can be removed the way a pick-up does, with its item given back (`emf.remove_building(world, id [, opts])`, in the table above). Host only, like
`emf.destroy` (the server world, inside a world callback). On a core older than API v36 it returns `false, "this EMF core is
too old (remove_building needs API v36)"`. `item_id` is nil when nothing went back.

| `opts` field | What |
|---|---|
| `refund` | `false` (default): nothing back. `"drop"`: a loose pickup at the object. A player's entity id: into that player's inventory (a drop at the object when it does not fit). Any other value is an error. |
| `force` | `true`: remove it even when it holds items: they drop at its spot as loose pickups (item, count, level and rarity; 0.6.8). Default false. |

Any other key is an error, so a typo cannot quietly lose the item.

It refuses, and changes nothing, for a player, a Flame Altar (even with `force`: use `emf.destroy` if you mean it), an
object no player placed (use `emf.destroy`), and an object holding items unless `force`. It plays no pick-up sound.
Details: [reference.md](reference.md), "v36".

```lua
emf.command("takedown", "<entity>: remove a placed object, the item to you", function(world, args)
  local id = tonumber(args[1])
  if not id then emf.reply("usage: takedown <entity>") return end
  local s = emf.sender()
  local ok, item = emf.remove_building(world, id, {refund = (s and s.entity ~= 0) and s.entity or "drop"})
  emf.reply(ok and ("removed, item " .. tostring(item)) or ("refused: " .. item))
end)
```

## Paths (1.29)

`emf.path_find(world, from, to [, opts], fn)` asks the game's own path grid for a path. The grid knows terrain,
buildings, placed objects and doors. It moves nothing. It returns an id, or nil (the reason is in the log). Host only,
like `emf.spawn`: a joined game has no path grid. `from` and `to` are `{x, y, z}` or `{x = , y = , z = }`, in metres, at
most 200 m apart. On a core older than API v37 it is nil.

The answer comes once, after a server step or more, to `fn(world, result, points)`:

- `result.status`: `"found"`, `"no_path"`, `"too_long"`, `"no_start"`, `"no_target"`, `"no_memory"`, `"cancelled"` or `"other"`;
- `result.reaches`: true when the last point is within 1.5 m across and 3 m up or down of `to`;
- `result.length`: metres from `from` along the points; `result.count`: the points (at most 512);
- `points`: a list of `{x, y, z, move}`; `move` is 0 walk, 2 jump up, 3 jump down, 4 jump across, 5 a door.

`emf.path_cancel(id)` returns true when the query was open. The callback still comes, with `"cancelled"`. A script that
is paused or reloaded before the answer hears nothing. Bad option values, or a position without three numbers, are Lua
errors.

| `opts` field | What |
|---|---|
| `jumps` | `true`: the path may jump up, down and across |
| `doors` | `true`: the path may open doors |
| `swim` | `true`: the path may swim |
| `closest` | `true`: when the target cannot be reached, end at the closest reachable point |
| `width`, `height` | the room the unit needs, in metres (0 to 64; default: the game's) |
| `max_jump_up`, `max_jump_down` | metres (0 to 255; 0 = no limit) |
| `nodes` | how many nodes the search may spend (0 to 20000; default 2000) |
| `owner` | an entity the query belongs to (default: the first player) |

Use `closest = true` and check `reaches`. Without `closest`, a target the grid cannot match (on a rock, in the air) ends
`"too_long"`. Long paths need more `nodes`: 2000 got about 36 m of a 141 m route, 20000 got about 90 m in about 1.3 s.
The grid exists only where the world is loaded, near players. Each query is a search in the game's own jobs, shared with
every walking creature: do not ask every step. Details: [reference.md](reference.md), "v37".

```lua
-- can this raider get to the altar?
emf.path_find(world, raider_pos, altar_pos, {closest = true, doors = true, nodes = 5000},
  function(w, result, points)
    if result.reaches then
      emf.log("raider can reach the altar in", result.length, "m")
    else
      emf.log("blocked:", result.status, "path stops after", result.length, "m")
    end
  end)
```

## Doors (1.30)

`emf.door(world, id)` returns `"open"` or `"closed"` plus a table `{locked = bool, logic = bool}`, or nil when the entity
is not a door (player doors and gates). `logic` is true when a switch drives the door: EMF does not touch it.

- `emf.door_open(world, id [, "front" | "back"])` and `emf.door_close(world, id)` change the door at the next server
  step; players see it swing, and the game's collider and path grid follow it, so enemies' paths change. No sound plays.
- `emf.door_lock(world, id, true | false)`: while locked, no player gets the E prompt on it. Not saved: it lasts until
  the world closes. `emf.door_open` and `emf.door_close` still work on a locked door.

The three actions return true when the door will change at the next step, and false when refused (not the server world,
not a door, a switch drives it, already so; the reason is in the log). Any other side word is a Lua error. Host only, like
`emf.spawn`. On a core older than API v38: nil and false.

```lua
-- when the attack starts, open the gate; the treasure room stays shut
local function raid_started(world)   -- your own raid code calls this
  emf.door_open(world, gate_id)
  emf.door_lock(world, treasure_door_id, true)
end
```

## Enemy orders (1.32)

`emf.enemy_order(world, enemy, target [, {seconds = n, damage = n, allies = true}])` sends a creature with an enemy AI
at any entity with a position: a player, a creature, a door, a gate, a placed object. While the order holds, EMF writes
the target as its pick and puts it in its aggro list, at once and after every server step, and puts an enemy at rest
(idle, roaming, at home, asleep) in its fight state, so it walks up and attacks. Seen in game: a Vukah walked 30 m to a
door, and one hit with `damage = 200` broke it.

- `seconds`: how long (default 0: until the target is gone or dead, the enemy is gone, or you cancel it).
- `damage`: the game's own hits on a placed door do 0 (seen); `damage` is added to each of the enemy's hits on the
  target (a hit rule), so a door can break.
- `allies = true`: the creature may be a player's ally (a tamed beast); without it such a creature is refused.

It returns the order's id, or nil and why (not the server world, no enemy AI, a player, a boss, no such target, a dead
target, bad numbers, more than 256 orders). An order also ends when its enemy dies or becomes a player's ally (tamed),
and when your script reloads or pauses. A new order on the same enemy ends the old one. When an order ends, the game picks
for the enemy again. Nothing is saved. `emf.enemy_order_cancel(id)` ends one; `emf.enemy_target(world, enemy)` is what
it goes for now (its pick), or nil. Host only, like `emf.spawn`. On a core older than API v39: nil and a reason.

```lua
-- a raid: the raider breaks the gate, then the game takes over
local id, why = emf.enemy_order(world, raider, gate, {seconds = 60, damage = 40})
if not id then emf.log("no order: " .. why) end
```

## Worlds and components

Callbacks get a `world` (valid only during that callback):

| Method | |
|---|---|
| `world:is_server()`, `world:is_client()` | which world: gameplay changes go to the server world (the host) |
| `world:tick()` | its tick counter |
| `world:entities()` | every entity id (a table) |
| `world:position(id)` | `x, y, z` in metres, or nil |
| `world:get(component, id)` | the entity's component, or nil |
| `world:template(component, id)` | (1.8) the entity's template half of a component: the data every entity of its template shares (for example `world:template("ModelResource", id).model`, the model GUID as text). Read-only: writing a field is an error. nil when the entity has none |
| `world:name(id)` | (1.6) a player's name, the one the game's chat shows (their platform name, not the character's), or nil (then say `"player #" .. id`); where players' chat is on, server world only |
| `world:character_name(id)` | (1.22) the player's character name (the Social tab's), or nil when not known: it may already be there in `on_player_joined` or come a few seconds later, and it can change during a session, so read it when you need it and never keep it. Text a player's game set, not an identity: key data by `p.account`. Server world only; players' chat need not be on |
| `world:account(id)` | a player entity's account as text ("0x" + 16 hex digits, as `emf.sender()` gives it), or nil: a key that stays the same for that player across sessions (entity ids do not); server world only |

`world:get` returns the component's data with its real field names (`sdk/include/emf/generated/components.hpp` lists
every component and its fields: search for `struct CurrentTransform`; `inspect <entity>` in the console shows what an
entity has):

```lua
local t = world:get("CurrentTransform", id)
emf.log(t.transform.position.x)          -- nested structs
local f = world:get("Faction", id)
f.faction = 11                           -- assign to change it (checked: 300 into a byte is an error)
local inv = world:get("Inventory", id)
emf.log(#inv.slots, inv.slots[1])        -- arrays: # and [1..n]
```

Ids, times and hashes (`EntityId`, `Time`, `HashKey32`) read and write as plain numbers. Reading a field the type
does not have is an error naming the type and the field (a typo would otherwise read nil); event tables check the same
way (`rawget(e, name)` reads one without the check). An unsigned 64-bit field at or above 2^63 reads as a float (so it
stays positive; floats hold such numbers only roughly, so a value within about 1024 of 2^64, like an all-ones
marker, reads as 2^64 and cannot be written back); NaN and infinity cannot be written into a float field.

A component can only be used during the callback that got it: keep ids, not components, between callbacks. Writing
changes the game's own data; what the game makes of it (and what it sends to other players) is the same as for a C++
mod: test in a spare world.

## Engine events

`emf.on_event` gives you each event as a table of its fields:

```lua
emf.on_event("EntityDiedEvent", function(world, e)
  emf.log("died:", e.deadEntityId)
end)
```

Common events: `HitEvent` (`rootSourceId` hit `targetId`), `EntityDiedEvent`, `PickupEvent`, `CraftRecipeEvent`,
`LevelUpEvent`, `ConsumeItemEvent` (`components.hpp` has all 129 with their fields, at its end the list `kEvents`); the console's `event_log` mod (C++) logs many of them, and `docs/engine_parts/re_events.md` explains
them. Call `emf.on_event` at the top of `main.lua`: an event that was not asked for when the game started needs a
restart (a reload tells you so; the rest of the mod runs). Event and component names are the short type names
(`HitEvent`); the game's full names (`keen::ecs::HitEvent`) work too. An event whose size in the game is not the size in
`components.hpp` (after a game update) is not delivered; the log says so once.

To make something happen, send the game's own events: declare them at the top of `main.lua`, then send them from any
callback. The host sends them on the next step of that world:

```lua
emf.emits({"NpcCommandEvent"})
emf.command("come", "<villager entity id>: that villager walks to you", function(world, args)
  local x, y, z = world:position(emf.local_player())
  emf.emit("server", "NpcCommandEvent", {
    type = 1, npcId = tonumber(args[1]),  -- 1 = GoToPosition (NpcCommandType in components.hpp)
    targetTransform = { position = { x = math.floor(x * 2^32), y = math.floor(y * 2^32), z = math.floor(z * 2^32) } },
  })
end)
```

(World positions inside the game's structs are fixed point: 1 m = 2^32. `world:position` already converts.)

## Settings

Declare settings in `mod.json` exactly as for C++ mods (see [reference.md](reference.md)): switches, numbers,
sliders with steps, lists, colours, key binds and text, under `group` headings, greyed out with `enabledWhen` while
another setting does not have some value. They show in the console's Mods tab, in EMF.exe and in `settings <id>`. Read
them with `emf.setting(key)`, every time you need them (the template reads them on each tick), and mark the ones you
apply at once `"live": true`; `emf.on_setting_changed` tells you when one changed. A setting added to or changed in
`mod.json` while the game runs shows in the Mods tab within a second (while a world is loaded); until then
`emf.setting` gives false, 0 or "" for a new one, so read settings when you use them rather than once at the top of
`main.lua`.

```lua
-- mod.json: {"key": "toggle_key", "type": "keybind", "default": "F7", "label": "Toggle", "live": true},
--           {"key": "tint", "type": "color", "default": "#ffd070", "live": true}
local on = true
emf.on_key("toggle_key", function(world) on = not on end)
emf.on_tick(function(world)
  if world:is_client() then emf.hud("line", on and "Hello" or "", "bottom_left", emf.setting("tint")) end
end)
```

## Saving data

A Lua mod keeps its variables while the game runs and loses them on reload or restart. Data that belongs to a world
(a score, a list of places) goes into the world's data; data for every world into a setting or a file of your own.

**Per world** (the `kill_counter` example keeps its count this way):

```lua
emf.on_world_data(function(world, text)   -- after the world loaded; "" the first time
  kills = tonumber(text:match("kills=(%d+)")) or 0
end)

-- whenever it changed:
emf.save_world_data("kills=" .. kills)
```

- `fn` runs once per world load, in the game that hosts the world (yours, or the dedicated server), on the server
  world's step, and again after your mod reloads. Registered later (say in a command, after the world loaded), it gets
  the world's current text on the next server step.
- `save_world_data` returns true when saved; false before a world has loaded, in someone else's game (also after you
  hosted a world earlier), and after your mod reloads until `fn` has run again, so nothing is ever written into the
  wrong world's file or over its data. It writes only when the text changed.
- The data is text; choose your own format. It is kept in `emf\config\<your mod id>\<world slot>.txt`, as for C++
  mods (`emf/storage.hpp`).

**Per player in a world** (`lua` 1.20): a text for each player, by their account (`world:account(id)`, or `p.account`
in `emf.on_player_joined`):

```lua
local visits = {}
emf.on_player_joined(function(world, p)
  local text = emf.player_data(p.account)        -- "" the first time
  visits[p.account] = (tonumber(text) or 0) + 1
  emf.save_player_data(p.account, tostring(visits[p.account]))
end)
```

- `emf.player_data(account)` gives the player's text, "" when none, and nil before the world's data came (the same
  moment `on_world_data` runs), where no world of yours runs, and while the world's players file cannot be read (not
  EMF's format: the log says so; another program had it open: it is read again). `emf.save_player_data(account, text)` saves it
  (`""` removes the player) under the same rules as `save_world_data`; it returns false over 16 KiB for one player or
  2 MiB for the world's file.
- An account is `"0x"` and up to 16 hex digits, as `world:account` gives it; anything else is an error. The all-zero
  account (the console's `emf.sender()`, the host's own `emf.net` messages) gives nil and false: use
  `world:account(emf.local_player())` for the host.
- Kept beside the world's data in `emf\config\<your mod id>\<world slot>.players.txt` (C++: `WorldFile::player` and
  `save_player`). Each save writes the whole file, so save when a player's text changed, not every step.

**Your own files:** write them into your own folder:

```lua
local f = io.open(emf.dir .. "\\scores.txt", "w")
f:write(kills, "\n")
f:close()
```

Use `emf.dir`: a path without a folder lands in the game's folder. File names are UTF-8 text (as `emf.dir` is), so
folders and files with letters such as æ, ø or å work in `io.open`, `require`, `loadfile` and `os.remove`. Give data
files another ending than `.lua`: saving a `.lua` file or `mod.json` reloads the mod.

## Lua or C++?

Lua is the quick way: no build, live reload, and a script error cannot crash the game. C++ (see [README.md](README.md)) reaches everything: mod programs,
hooks into engine functions (`hook_pattern`), template data, memory writes, and it runs faster in tight loops. Both can
live side by side, and a Lua mod can depend on a C++ mod in `mod.json`.
