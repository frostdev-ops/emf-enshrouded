// EMF.exe's card "EML content" (docs/engine_parts/content_loader.md "What the player sees"): who applies the content
// of the EML mods at the next start ("Play" on the game client) and why, the last build's outcome, which mods were
// built and which are left out, the shadow copy's disk use, and EML's dbghelp.dll set aside by EMF (E5).
//
// It is computed from the game folder with the loader's own rules (src/loader/: content_owner.h, eml_mods.h,
// content_base.h, content_state.h, content_fingerprint.h, content_shadow.h, the redirect's shadow.txt check), so
// EMF.exe and the loader cannot disagree. It reads sizes and times, the mods' mod.json, the state and the record; it
// never loads emf_content.dll (the licence boundary: only the loader does, at the held start) and never writes.
