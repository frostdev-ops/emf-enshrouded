"""Blender (headless): fit a four-legged creature mesh onto a game skeleton exported by gamegltf.py.

  blender --background --factory-startup --python fit_to_game_skeleton.py -- \
      <game.glb> <creature.glb> <out.glb> [--uv-from 1] [--material 1] [--size 1.0] [--vertex-colors]
      [--width fit|keep|<scale>] [--tail own|hips|fit] [--own-proportions <sidecar.json>] [--rigid <bone>,...]

Steps:
 1. Import the game model (armature with jNNN bones + its body meshes) and the creature (any rig; it is dropped).
 2. Fit the creature onto the game body with a piecewise-linear warp along the body (nose, front feet, back feet)
    and scales for height (top of the back between the legs) and width, so its legs sit on the game's leg bones.
    When the game's rest pose holds one pair of feet lower than the other (the sabretooth's front paws), the
    creature's legs stretch below the belly to reach them (../quad_landmarks.py). The width is fitted to the game
    body's (--width fit, the default); --width keep keeps the creature's own proportions (the mean of its length and
    height scales), for a creature stretched much more in length and height than in width.
 3. Copy bone weights from all game meshes (nearest surface) and UVs from one game mesh (--uv-from), so the creature
    can use that mesh's material and textures (--material, the game material index). Detail bones then keep weight
    only where the creature has that detail (../quad_landmarks.py clean_detail_weights): a big rump on a small tail's
    bones would swing with the tail, a head on a crest's bones would bend with the crest. The spine and the legs keep
    their weights (the legs: the four branches off the spine that reach lowest, named or not; the fit stops when the
    skeleton has no four); bones under the head keep theirs when the game animal itself uses them on its head (the jaw).
    --tail hips gives the creature's own tail to the hips too (a long tail driven by a short tail's animation moves
    strangely); the default, own, keeps the game animal's tail bones on the creature's tail; fit (with
    --own-proportions) moves the game's tail bones along the creature's own tail, keeping their spacing, and weights
    the tail along its length (a long or curled tail on a short tail's bones). --rigid <bone>,... puts
    everything below those bones on them (a cat's paw on the wrist, not on the game creature's clawed fingers).
 4. --own-proportions <sidecar.json>: the creature keeps its own shape. After the weights it goes back to its
    original proportions (uniformly scaled to the game body's height, times --size), and the sidecar lists every game
    joint moved into that shape by the inverse of the fit (../quad_landmarks.py unwarp, own_space): positions in this
    script's space for a copy of the game skeleton with the creature's proportions (tools/models/make_mod.py).
    The .glb keeps the game armature as it is.
 5. --vertex-colors stores the creature's own material colours as vertex colours (COLOR_0).
 6. Export a skinned .glb that tools/models/make_mod.py reads.
Blender axes after the glTF import: forward is -Y (the head), up is +Z, width is X.
