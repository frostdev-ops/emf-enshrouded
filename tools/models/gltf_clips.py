"""glTF animations made into game clips (keen::JointAnimation) for a skeleton from new_skeleton.py.

A clip has a key at every frame at 60 fps (the rate of every game clip) from the animation's first key to its last:
N frames (the duration times the rate, rounded), the animation sampled at N + 1 evenly spaced times, so a duration
that is not a whole number of frames plays slightly faster or slower and still ends on its last key. Channels are
sampled as glTF defines them (LINEAR: linear, rotations by slerp; STEP: held; CUBICSPLINE: Hermite with the stored
tangents), nodes without a channel keep their own pose, and every frame is a pose of the skeleton
(new_skeleton.pose: each joint as in the file's world, in game space).
