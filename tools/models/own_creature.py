"""A creature on its own proportions, for make_mod.py: a copy of the game skeleton fitted to the creature, and every
clip of the game creature's animation graph retargeted to it.

The creature's pack entry has "own_proportions":
  sidecar          the fitter's sidecar (blender/fit_to_game_skeleton.py --own-proportions): every game joint moved
                   into the creature's shape
  skeleton_guid    the skeleton copy's GUID (fixed forever, like the model's)
  reference_clip   a game clip whose first frame is the game creature standing (its idle): motions are taken
                   relative to it and put onto the creature standing in its own shape
  clips            a glob of the game clips to retarget (EML dumps of keen::JointAnimation, named <owner>_<guid>.json):
                   every clip the graph can play
  graph            the game creature's animation graph GUID; graph_guid: its copy's GUID

The skeleton copy keeps the game skeleton's joints and names (so its hash, and the clips' link to it, stay) and every
bone's frame (the rest rotations); only the joints move, to where the creature stands in its own shape, and its
inverse binds are that pose's. A clip frame becomes: each joint turned in the world as the game creature's turned away
from its standing pose (own_skeleton.retarget), which does not depend on the bones' frames. Turning frames to point
along the creature's limbs (own_skeleton.align_rest) is not used: the game graph's own nodes turn bones about their
axes, and a turned frame tilts them (seen in game: a pelvis turned 90 degrees, from a bone of zero length, sat the
panther upright).
