"""Clips made from a few key turns on top of a pose: a death, a flinch or a lean for a creature whose own animations
lack one.

Keys: [{"t": seconds, "turn": {joint name: [axis, degrees]}}, ...], the first at 0 s, times rising. A key's turns
are where those joints stand turned at that time (a joint a key does not name is not turned then); between two keys
every joint's turn eases (smoothstep, slerp) from the one to the other, and the clip ends on the last key. An axis is
"x", "y", "z" or a vector in the creature's own frame (game space: x across, y up, z forward), carried along by the
turns of the joint's parents: a neck turned about x after the body rolled onto its side still nods along the body.

offset() makes a clip for a graph's additive layer (offsets added to the pose, as the game wolf's lean that turns its
neck and head into a turn): per joint a turn about the creature's axis expressed in the joint's own rest frame, no move
and scale 0 (an additive layer adds scales).
