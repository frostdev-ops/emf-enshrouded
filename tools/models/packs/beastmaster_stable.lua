-- The Stable and the Large Stable: beds for tamed beasts that players craft at the Workbench and place in their base;
-- Beastmaster opens its Beasts window with E at them (mods/beastmaster/stable.lua knows them by their render models),
-- and shows the beasts a player left at home inside the Large Stable (mods/beastmaster/home.lua). A content script of
-- the beasts pack (make_mod.py "content_scripts"), run with EMF's helper emf_content.lua (docs/modding/content.md).
--
-- Each is a copy of the large animal bed's object without the parts farm animals and villagers use, nor the ones that
-- let monsters target and break it (furniture such as the crafting stations has none of them), with a prop model of
-- the pack (beastmaster_stable, beastmaster_large_stable: a stable with a thatched roof; make_mod "props") under its own
-- model GUID, which Beastmaster knows it by, and boxes of its own to stand on and bump into. When its model was not made,
-- it takes a copy of the bed's record under the same GUID (the bed's look). A dedicated server has no render data: there
-- the template names the model all the same, as the game's own templates do.
--
-- The GUIDs below are FIXED FOREVER: saves keep the items by their GUIDs and placed stables by their templates' GUIDs,
-- and Beastmaster knows the models by their GUIDs.
