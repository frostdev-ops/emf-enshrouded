-- Home: the beasts a player left at home (in their collection, not out) live in the Large Stable nearest them (the
-- beasts pack's; stable.lua HOMES) while the player is within HOME_M of it; they leave when the player is farther than
-- LEAVE_M. A Large Stable has room for ROOM beasts, all players together: the beasts shown stay, then the others by
-- account and list order. Server world only.
--   Each is spawned on a spot of its own on the stable's floor (SPOTS, in the stable's frame: x across, z out of its
--   open side, turned with the stable's CurrentTransform) as a player-side creature at its owner's level and its
--   loyalty's size, told to guard the stable (the game's own roaming near it), and turned to face out of the open side.
--   Scenes, in turns: a stroll (the game's roaming; the first FIRST_S, then STROLL_S) and a rest (REST_S, held in the
--   game's Sleep state as idle.lua holds a beast: one whose graph has sleep states lies down, the others stand still),
--   facing out. A stroll that ends off the floor puts the beast back on its spot before it rests; a beast ROAM_M or more
--   from the stable's middle for AWAY_S is put back at once (the game's teleport, with a ground search).
--   A beast the Sleep state cannot hold (no enemy AI state) strolls on.
--   At night (NIGHT_FROM to DAWN by the game's clock) they rest the whole night: a stroll ends at once, a rest goes on;
--   in the morning each rest ends when it was due, so they get up one by one.
--   Each carries the game's "E Pet" prompt (emf.offer; offered again every OFFER_EVERY_S while EMF no longer holds it).
--   A pet turns the beast to the player and settles it for PET_S (a rest); its owner's pet earns it a loyalty point
--   (env.gain) once a game day (the days are counted at each dawn the game's clock passes, while the world runs).
--   It never fights (its aggro and chosen targets are cleared every step). A hit on one of them, or a creature's hit on
--   a player within BUILD_M of their stable, sends that stable's beasts inside (out of the world) until SHELTER_S after
--   the last such hit. It has the health it has when called (its role, loyalty and talents: env.on_spawn) and is healed
--   to full every second; one that dies anyway is removed and shows up again after RESPAWN_S. Its owner loses nothing:
--   the collection is not touched.
--   They leave the world when they are called (leave, before the call's spawn), sent away or released, their owner is
--   away or left, the setting home_beasts is off, the stable is gone, or (with the setting make_room) a player builds
--   within BUILD_M of it (the game blocks building next to creatures); back GRACE_S after the building stops.
--   A creature is ours while it is there with the SpawnTime first read from it (the game gives ids out again: another
--   creature on the id is left alone); one of ours that is no longer player-side is taken out.
--   A kind the game cannot spawn (its pack is not installed), or whose creature does not become player-side, is tried
--   again after RETRY_S, logged once per kind.
--   The game's time (for the Sleep lease) is kept as an offset from env.now, taken again from each new home beast's
--   SpawnTime.
--   After the script's start (a reload) the player-side creatures running a beast's animation graph within ROAM_M of a
--   Large Stable's middle that are none of ours and guard no player (a beast out guards its owner) are the beasts the
--   script had there before: taken out of the world at the first check that has a Large Stable.
-- M.new(env) where env has: now(world), setting(key), beasts() (the roster), homes() (the Large Stables: stable.lua
-- S:homes()), present() (account -> player entity, nil before the first check), log(text), on_spawn(world, id, sp,
-- health_mul) (optional: the health watch), tell(world, player, text) and gain(world, account, beast) (a loyalty
-- point; both optional: a pet then only settles the beast).
