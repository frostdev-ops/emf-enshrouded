-- The beasts a Beastmaster can tame and call.
--   template:   the game template a call spawns (it runs the enemy AI, which follows StartGuardingEvent)
--   graph:      the animation graph a wild creature of that kind runs (its template data on the server world:
--               world:template("AnimationGraphResourceComponent2", id).animationGraph; render models are client-side)
--   also:       another graph that is this kind too (the bear pack 2's bear runs its own graph copy, the older
--               pack's ran the wolf's)
--   factions:   when several kinds share a graph: the factions that make it this kind (the wolf's graph is also the
--               scavengers' hound's)
--               a beast on a skeleton of its own (the beasts pack's snake) runs its own copy of a game graph: its
--               graph alone tells it apart
--   min_scale / max_scale: when kinds share a graph and a faction, the creature's ScaleComponent tells them apart
--               (the bear pack's bear runs the wolf's graph at 1.4x: seen in game, game wolves have no ScaleComponent;
--               the beasts pack's aurochs runs the boar's graph at 1.3x).
--               M.of takes the first that fits, in list order
--   pack:       the content pack (an EML data patch, built by EMF at the game's start) the beast comes from, named for notes; a game without that pack
--               has no such template: the call fails, a wild one never comes
--   health_mul: a wild one's health, times the game's base health (health.lua); the pack's template sets size, damage
--               and speed
--   scale:      the pack template's ScaleComponent (a called beast's loyalty size goes on top of it; none: 1)
--   role_health, role_damage: a tamed one's health and damage against a wild one of its kind at the same level (its
--               template's, without health_mul), before loyalty: a wolf hunts (x1.2, x1.15), a boar holds (x1.7, x0.9)
-- Baits are settings ("bait_<id>"), read when used.
